### Observations from the analysis
1. During my analysis, I found that Friday, Saturday and Sunday were the busiest days of the week with the most number of bike trips.
2. Subscribers had a higher number of bike rides compared to those who were customers who paid for a 24-hour pass or 3-day pass.
3. Men had higher number of ride bikes compared to women, regardless of customer type. 
4. Women had longer bike rides than men when they purchased a 24-hour pass or a 3-day pass. There were no differences observed in average distance biked in men or women who were annual subscribers. 
5. Young women who were customers who paid for a 24-hour pass or 3 day pass and born during 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s had the longest bike durations of all gender and age-groups who paid for a 24-hour pass or 3 day pass.
